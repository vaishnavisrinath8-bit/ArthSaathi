# ArthSaathi — 4 Day Hackathon Roadmap

AI Powered Rural Financial Intelligence Platform

---

# Important Note

This roadmap must always stay aligned with:

```txt
docs/
│
├── architecture.md
├── roadmap.md
├── api-specs.md
├── frontend-structure.md
├── backend-structure.md
├── ai-service-structure.md
├── database-schema.md
├── setup-guide.md
└── demo-script.md
```

Whenever:
- API contracts change
- folder structures change
- architecture changes
- database schema changes
- frontend routes change

the corresponding `.md` file inside `docs/` must also be updated immediately.

---

# Main Goal

Build a working MVP capable of:

- Voice AI interaction
- Expense tracking
- Financial planning
- Loan risk analysis
- Scam detection
- RTC OCR extraction
- Dashboard analytics
- Multilingual support

within 4 days.

# Final Architecture

```txt
React Native Expo App
          ↓
Node.js Backend
          ↓
FastAPI AI Service
          ↓
OpenAI / Whisper / OCR

# Team Distribution

| Member | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Member 1 | Backend APIs + Authentication |
| Member 2 | Database + Backend Integration |
| Member 3 | AI Service + OCR + Voice |
| Member 4 | Frontend + Dashboard + Voice UI |

---

# Development Rules

# Rule 1

Nobody waits for anyone.

Use:
- mock JSON
- mock APIs
- dummy responses

until actual APIs are integrated.

---

# Rule 2

API contracts are fixed on Day 1.

Never randomly change:
- request structure
- response structure
- endpoint names

without informing everyone.

---

# Rule 3

Every completed feature must update docs.

Example:

If:
```txt
/api/analyze
```

changes,

then:
```txt
docs/api-specs.md
```

must also be updated.

---

# Rule 4

Folder structure changes must update docs.

If:
- new module added
- new route added
- new folder created

update:
- backend-structure.md
- ai-service-structure.md
- frontend-structure.md

---

# Rule 5

Database changes must update schema docs.

If:
- new Prisma model added
- relation changed

update:
```txt
docs/database-schema.md
```

---

# Rule 6

Demo flow changes must update:

```txt
docs/demo-script.md
```

---
